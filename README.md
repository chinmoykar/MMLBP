# MMLBP
Softwares and code towards the development of MMLBP:
The source code of Multilayer Mulyi-block LBP is available at https://github.com/chinmoykar/MMLBP. 
The name of the file is MMLBP.m.
The state of the art Multi block local binary pattern is implemented through MLBP.m
The code for MMLBP is implemented by GNU Octave 4.2.0 (https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) 
Extracted features are used for classification by Weka tool (https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/) 
Images dataset has been collected from https://www.nrlmry.navy.mil/tcdat. 

RMSE_MMLBP : RMSE for the proposed model after classification
RMSE_MBLBP : RMSE for the MBLBP after classification

MMLBP_reduced: File with selected features (21 features)
MBLBP_reduced: File with selected features (42 features)
